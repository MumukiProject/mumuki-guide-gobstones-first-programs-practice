Let's see a first example!
 
The next program places one red stone in the initial position and one black stone to the east.

```gobstones
program {
  Drop(Red)
  Move(East)
  Drop(Black)
}
```

> Try writing and executing this program. We will show you the result when executing it on a 2x2 board and on a 3x2, both with the head placed initially in the origin.
